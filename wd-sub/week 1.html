  Hi Rebekah, a couple notes about your week 1 submission:
    First off, it looks like you have most of the organization with the headings. We put the section labeled "title" in a h3 level heading though.
    Additionally, it seems like you accidentally pasted the page contents twice within the page. Please clean up the duplicate elements.

    Now a general note about your approach to coding. You'll have to pay attention to little details like spaces and dashes.
    Sometimes they'll be the difference between your code working perfectly and failing altogether.
    Two examples I see in this first submission: the /wdsub/ folder and the week1.html filename itself.
    Naming your folder "wd-sub" is okay, but I'll ask that you keep consistent with the class for our folder names.
    For this page file, you put a space between "week" and "1". We never want to put a space in filenames. Either use a dash or put no character between them.

    Finally, on Friday we made a link on our homepage to this page. In the future, that is how I will access your webpage submissions.
    Please put a link on your homepage to this page.
